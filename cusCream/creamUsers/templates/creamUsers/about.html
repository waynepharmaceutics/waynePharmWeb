		<p style="font-family:Museo">Wayne Pharmaceutics is the culmination of a lifelong passion of Dr. Yun "Wayne" Chen. Ever since childhood Dr. Chen has always had a passion for
		mixing things together to create something new. While at pharmacy school, he took a keen interest in pharmaceutical compounding.
		After attaining a Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree, Dr. Chen began his work in retail pharmacy. He wanted to be at the front lines of pharmacy to 
		maximize his ability to help his patients.<br/><br/><br/>
		During his career in retail pharmacy, Dr. Chen attained two specialty certifications that gave him a better insight into
		the world of medicine and health products. First was his Certification on Medication Therapy Management (CMTM). Having a CMTM certification
		meant he had a more specialized grasp of patient counseling, as well as a more real world approach to how patients take and use medications and
		other health products. He also became certified as a Pharmacy Regulatory Specialist (PRS). The PRS Certification gave him specialized knowledge
		on both state and federal regulation pertaining to both medicine and health products.<br/><br/><br/>
		During his many consultations with patients, many of whom were diabetics with nerve issues, or cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and
		radiation, he was constantly asked by patients for recommendations on skin products to both protect and maintain skin health.  
		He stressed that there was no such thing as a perfect option for each individual because the products were all bulk-produced
		using set ingredients and formulas. After all, these products were to be mass marketed. When asked by patients what other options they had, 
		he suddenly realized that there were no other alternatives for them other than crafting skin products directly for them. It was through this 
		epiphany that Dr. Chen realized the only true way for an individual to get a skin product just for them was to craft it specifically
		for them. Thus, Wayne Pharmaceutics was born.</p>

	<div class="aboutmain">
		<p style="font-family:Museo">The idea is simple. You give us your info about your skin and skin product preferences, and we tell you 
		what ingredients would best fit you. That's not to say you don't get a say. We love learning, because learning more helps us make
		better things. But, we also want to educate you, our users, so that not only can you understand what the ingredients are for, but 
		also to figure out what may or may not work for you. <br/><br/><br/><p style="text-align:center">After all, who knows your skin better than you?</p>
